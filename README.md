Patent Citation Networks: A Graph Theory Representation

Motivation:
---

Patents are mechanisms for individuals, companies, or governments to legally “own” ideas. The United States patent office states that a granted patent gives the patent owner **“the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling”** an idea or process for 20 years after the patent is granted, thus creating a legal monopoly over the implementation of an idea. I don't like monopolies.


Encouraging economic progress and innovation is meant to be at the heart of the rational for patents or intellectual property (IP) rights.  and is encouraged  meant to encourage economic progress they are meant to encourage companies to invest in research, encourage the sharing company "trade secrets" with society, and protecting the rights for humans to benefit from "the product of his/her mind."

Rise of Patent Trolls

In essense those sound like good reasons, however it



but not  and thus control a monopoly of the u  production technique. In the US  

Overview:
I used graph theory
Summary:


Problem: Can we use graph theory to gain a better understanding of how patents are organized.

EDA:

graph of how many patents filed by year
graph of how many patents filed by company
degree's of whole graph - 770 max


law of exponential degree (something like this) - as edges increase paths become shorter between nodes

Find - amount of sub categories - names of subcategories
Find - Data graph of "who" (company (national vs individual vs government vs international of previous)

Find - company information on patents


My model:

overall graph of all data
Centralities of all data

Community attempt #1:
pipes in pipes

problem is finding connected graphs

looked up "key patents" and found their "dependencies"



looking at just one patent: then patents going back in time off that patent

changed data to have companies as nodes and looked at selective companies


show connections between genetic patent

show connections between "company patents" show color changes to highlight information
