Patent Analysis

Overview:

Problem: Can we use graph theory to gain a better understanding of how patents are organized.

EDA:

graph of how many patents filed by year
graph of how many patents filed by company
degree's of whole graph - 770 max


law of exponential degree (something like this) - as edges increase paths become shorter between nodes

Find - amount of sub categories - names of subcategories
Find - Data graph of "who" (company (national vs individual vs government vs international of previous)

Find - company information on patents


My model:

overall graph of all data
Centralities of all data

Community attempt #1:
pipes in pipes

problem is finding connected graphs

looked up "key patents" and found their "dependencies"



looking at just one patent: then patents going back in time off that patent

changed data to have companies as nodes and looked at selective companies


show connections between genetic patent

show connections between "company patents" show color changes to highlight information
