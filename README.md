Patent Analysis

Overview:

Problem: Can we use graph theory to gain a better understanding of how patents are organized.

EDA:
Find - amount of sub categories - names of subcategories
Find - Data graph of "who" (company (national vs individual vs government vs international of previous)


My model:
overall graph of all data
Centralities of all data
